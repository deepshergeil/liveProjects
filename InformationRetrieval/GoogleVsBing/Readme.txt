++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1)The exercise is about comparing the search results from Google versus Bing, the two leading US search engines.

2)The process I will follow is to issue a set of queries and to evaluate the returned results for relevance.

3)The studies do not seek to answer the ultimate question of which search engine is “best”. Rather we stick to more modest research questions which are:

- Which search engine performs best when considering the first five results for a given query?

- Is there a difference in relevance between the search engines when considering informational queries and navigational queries, respectively?

In the Excel Sheet,We have different table for different Queries(On top of Each Table),

--Relevence Score for Each Query ranges from(0~1).Where 0 refers no relevance and 1 refers high relevant.

--Ultimately,we have plot the graph for each query relevances showing difference between Google and Bing search Engines.

--In the End,we concluded,which search Engine provides the most relevant result for any query with reason.
